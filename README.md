# Alpine Gitlab Docker

[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/alpinelinux/alpine-docker-gitlab/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/alpinelinux/alpine-docker-gitlab)

Alpine Linux based docker image and tools for Gitlab.

## Why another Gitlab docker image?

 - Completely based on Alpine Linux (no static binaries)
 - Use separate docker images for services (where possible)
 - Optimized for size
 - Bundle services with docker compose

## Setup

To get Gitlab up and running you need to first generate 2 secrets and provide
then as environment variables. Most suitable is via [.env](https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/)
file in alongside your docker-compose file. Mandatory variables are:

 - GITLAB_HOSTNAME
 - GITLAB_ROOT_PASSWORD
 - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
 - POSTGRES_USER

After which you need to create and bring up the containers

```docker-compose up -d```

To view the log run

```docker-compose logs -f```

Watch the output on console for errors. It will take some time to generate the db
and update permissions. Ones its done without errors you can Ctrl+c to stop the
containers and start them again in the background.

## Access the application

Visit your Gitlab instance at http://dockerhost

## Configuration

The default configuration is very limited. The custom configuration is stored
in `/etc/gitlab` in the container and will be copied to the config directory
inside `/home/git/gitlab/config`. Any new configuration added will be
automatically copied to the container. Any existing configuration will not
be overwritten.

Location of the configuration on the host depends on the volume settings. the
default locations is:

```bash 
cd /srv/docker/gitlab/config
```

Modify a configuration file and restart the containers.

## Additional functions

The entrypoint command has some additional function. To show them run:

```bash
docker-compose exec gitlab gitlab help
```

### Backups

To exclude some items from the backup you can set the environment variable
`$GITLAB_BACKUP_SKIP` which will set `SKIP=` see:
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/backup_restore.html

## Gitlab 16

Gitlab 16 requires postgres 13 or higher. This image will use postgresql 15,
and switches the storage directory.

You can use [pg-upgrade][] to migrate the existing postgres12 database to
postgres15.
